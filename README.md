# Dotslash_TotalRefurb
Project Title- TotalRefurb

Project Description: 
 Our project focuses on following points:
 1] We bring in users for selling their old waste electronics products.The user will be paid based on the condition of the product.The condition of product is determined as follows:
 2] Visual Inspection Of Waste Product.
 3] Prior Repair Attempt and replacement of Parts.
 4] Deep Cleaning of Product.
 5] In-Depth Testing.
 6] If tests fail we recover electronic components from the PCBs of the product.
 7] If tests pass we sell it for cheap prices on our website.
 
 Technologies used:
 1] HTML- We used this technoloy to give a skeloton to our page.
 2] CSS- We used CSS to style and beautify our page. 
 3] Django(python)- It's a framework which can be used for backend using python language and inbuilt database db sqlite.
 4] Bootstrap- we used this to speed up our process of writing existing html,css and Javascript and then customise it as per our needs.
 5] Javascript- We used this to add functionality to our page from client side.
 
 Challenges faced:
 1] While submitting forms in django we faced various errors like "TypeError","NOT NULL constraint error","Integrity error","non string (type non type) error".
 2] We also faced challenges while pushing code in github like pushing wrong files in repo and reverting it was a tedious job as it showed error "cant push code as it is not in your local store..."
 
 Features we hope to implement:
 1] Extending thr range of our products from smallest electronic part to a well assembled product.
 2] Completing the functionalities using js.
 
 Our Motivation:
 1] Right to Repair was one of our biggest motivation to build this project.
 
 Problem solved with our project:
 1] Reinforcing the idea of easy repairibility and reliable part outsourcing.
 
 Installation and running of a server:
 1] Download the repo as a zip file and extract it.
 2] Open the folder in your editor and open terminal.
 3] Make sure you have python and pip installed.
 4] In terminal write "pip install django".
 5] Then write "python manage.py runserver"
 6] After this command it will dispaly a link in terminal which on clicking will link you to the website.
 
 Steps to use the project:
 1] The folder has two parts one is the project folder and other is the app folder.
 2] The project folder has "settings.py" file,add name of the app in "settings.py".
 3] The app folder has "urls.py","views.py" which are used to link the pages from one html file to other.
 4] All the HTML files are stored in the Templates folder inside the app folder.
 5] The static folder has the image, css and js folder.
